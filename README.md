# Downloading

* Now we only need the link to download BiliBili.tv. I leave you some examples so that you can see the type of link that it has to be:
  * https://www.bilibili.tv/en/play/1006275/10225348? ✅
  * https://www.bilibili.tv/en/video/2047048102? ✅
  * https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Sr4y127Qw/? ❌

* As an example link we will take the second one that lasts more than 1 hour.

# IMPORTANT

* When I want to copy the link, for some reason cmd does not let me, what you must do is to press the right click of the mouse to be able to paste it.

* Once the link is pasted, enter and wait patiently for it to download and join the video + audio. Here it will depend on your internet and if the BiliBili server is working well lol.

_Note: When the download is executed, a Downloads folder will be created in the same folder and the videos will be stored there._
